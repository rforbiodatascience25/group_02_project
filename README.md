### Description

In this project we will analyse the data from the paper "**Apoptosis and other immune biomarkers predict influenza vaccine responsiveness**". In the original paper, researchers used blood samples from 89 healthy people before and after vaccination and sequenced them in Illumina BeadScan. We will combine the test data with the metadata given and then analyse them to visualise the response to the vaccine based on the age, gender, BMI, CMV or EBV possitive and type of antibody.

### Loading the data

We used the script in 01_load.qmd to load the data from GEO repository under accession number [GSE41080](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE41080).

For the metadata we downloaded the file from the supplementary material under Data set 1 with file name msb201315-s2.csv and upload it to our folder /data/metadata manually.
